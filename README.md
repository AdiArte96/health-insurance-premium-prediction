\# Health Insurance Premium Prediction



📌 Predictive analytics project developed as part of my MBA coursework at University Canada West.  

📅 Date: February 2024  

👨‍🎓 Author: Aditya Arte



\## 📄 Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating health insurance premiums using demographic and health-related data. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, regression, and piecewise linear regression — all implemented using Microsoft Excel.



\## 🧠 Key Insights

\- Simple linear regression model achieved 75.1% accuracy (R² = 0.751)

\- Region-wise piecewise regression improved accuracy to 76%

\- Group-based piecewise model using gender, region, and smoking status achieved \*\*85% accuracy\*\*
